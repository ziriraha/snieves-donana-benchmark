        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
            Wildlife image classification and detection represent key technologies for monitoring animal populations,
            protecting endangered species, and identifying predatory species that impact livestock using camera traps.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project (inspired by the Serengeti Benchmark, focused on the fauna of Serengeti National Park in
            Tanzania, Africa) will be implemented in the Doñana and Sierra de las Nieves parks. More than 30 terabytes
            of images provided by the EnBiC2Lab Lab project will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientific comparison is essential. By establishing a benchmark, a standard is provided against which other
            researchers can evaluate their results, fostering innovation in the field.

        <h2>Our objective</h2>
        <p>
            By developing a benchmark using images from these parks and providing the dataset. Our goal is to encourage
            other researchers to develop their own
            models with this data and compare them with ours.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>The functionalities developed in this project include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An interface for downloading and filtering over 30 terabytes of camera trap images collected from two
                protected areas.</li>
            <li>An interface for applying an animal detection model.</li>
            <li>An API enabling programmatic access to the previously mentioned functionalities.</li>
